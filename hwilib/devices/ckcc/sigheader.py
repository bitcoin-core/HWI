# Our simple firmware header.
# Although called a header, this data is placed into the middle of the binary.
# It is located at start of firmware + 16k - sizeof(heaer). This is a gap unused in normal
# micropython layout. Exactly the last 64 bytes (signature) should be left out of
# the checksum. We do checksum areas beyond the end of the last byte of firmware (up to length)
# and expect those regions to be unprogrammed flash (ones).
# - timestamp must increase with each upgrade (downgrade protection)
# - version_string is for humans only
# - pubkey_num indicates which pubkey was used for signature
# - firmware_length, must be:
# - bigger than minimum length, less than max
# - 512-byte aligned
# - bootloader assumes the flash filesystem (FAT FS) follows the firmware.
# - this C header file is somewhat parsed and used by python signature-adding code
# - timestamp is YYMMDDHHMMSS0000 in BCD
